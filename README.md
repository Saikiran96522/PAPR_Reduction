The Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) presents a formidable obstacle within
contemporary communication systems utilizing Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. Elevated PAPR not only results in power wastage
but also necessitates the utilization of costly and power-intensive hardware components,
thereby imposing constraints on the practical realization of such systems. This
manuscript undertakes a thorough examination of PAPR reduction techniques within
hardware-constrained environments, with a primary focus on strategies that effectively
mitigate PAPR without imposing undue burdens on hardware resources. Diverse
methodologies including clipping and filtering, selected mapping (SLM), tone
reservation (TR), and active constellation extension (ACE) are scrutinized regarding
their efficacy, intricacy, and hardware prerequisites. Furthermore, the discourse delves
into emerging methodologies harnessing the power of machine learning and deep
learning for PAPR reduction in settings constrained by hardware limitations. By
shedding light on the latest advancements in this domain, this review facilitates the
development of efficient and practical communication systems by offering valuable
insights into mitigating PAPR while navigating hardware constraints.
